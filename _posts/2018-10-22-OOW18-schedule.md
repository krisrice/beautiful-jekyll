### 11:15-12:00 Finally: DevOps for Databases
DevOps has become a common practice in the IT world. Many development teams use DevOps today to reduce turnaround times and get to market faster. Naturally, people in the administrative world are looking at what DevOps can do for them. After all, DevOps is short for Development and Operations. Yet there still seems to be a wider gap to adopting DevOps than there should be. Lots of tasks are still done manually and increase the turnaround time for no good reason. Attend this session to learn more.

### 11:00-11:45 Lessons Learned in Building Applications Used by Millions
Writing an application is easy. But to write an application that works in a lot of environments and performs with expected results, you need experience to point out the pitfalls an application can fall prey to. This session explores how an application can get built with an eye on the future and a lesson from the past. It looks at architecture, builds, performance, fails, and fixes and leaves you with a list of things you can use in your applications today.
